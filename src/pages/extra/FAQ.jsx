        {
            question: "How does bujji answer questions?",
            answer: "When you ask a question, bujji first checks its internal Vector DB for any stored knowledge. If nothing useful is found, it searches Wikipedia and converts the result into a clean, readable markdown response â€” often with images, links, and references."
        },
        {
            question: "What is Kids Mode?",
            answer: "Kids Mode makes bujji's responses fun and easier to understand for children. It adds emojis ðŸŽ‰, friendly words, and simpler explanations to help young learners enjoy their experience."
        },
        {
            question: "Does bujji hallucinate or guess answers?",
            answer: "No. bujji prioritizes facts. It only answers from its sources: Vector DB, Wikipedia, or internal fallback knowledge (only with your permission). It never guesses or gives personal opinions."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I see images and links in the answers?",
            answer: "Yes! When bujji pulls information from Wikipedia, it formats the response with images, bullet points, and clickable links to references â€” all neatly structured in markdown."
